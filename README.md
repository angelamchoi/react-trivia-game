# üîÆquizzify
quizzify is a web application that allows you to add trivia questions and play trivia games to enhance your trivia gaming skills.

## Inspiration
I love learning, but if the learning experience is gamified, I will be able to retain the information longer and learn more. I wanted to create an application for people to continue to learn new things while having fun.

## Getting Started
