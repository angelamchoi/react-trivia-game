# üîÆquizzify
quizzify is a web application that allows you to add trivia questions and play trivia games to enhance your trivia gaming skills.

## Inspiration
I love learning, but if the learning experience is gamified, I will be able to retain the information longer and learn more. I wanted to create an application for people to continue to learn new things while having fun.

ERD can be found [here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/29ba2d8e-8464-40bf-b81c-e8fd676560dd/edit?page=0_0#)
- The ERD helped us to create and structure our models and deeply think about their relationships such as one to many, many to one, or many to many.

## Reflection / Difficulties Faced
‚ù§Ô∏èThings we enjoyed:
- Incoporating our ideas 
    - If either us of had an idea we ran it by each other and took ownership and did our best to execute it. 
- Front-end & Back-end
    - We both took turns working on front-end and back-end
- Pair programming 
    - We both learned so much from each other. We would teach other when we solved something differently or added something new.

‚õ∞Ô∏èDifficulties Faced: 
- Routing
- 

üìöLessons Learned:

- Teamwork makes the dream work
    - Your coding and problem solving skills go further when working together in a team environment
    - Encountered more problems, but also learned how to solve them quicker 

- Take more risks
    - At first we were scared to push anything on to our main branch. Later on we realized that we can always retrieve our previous work, so we began to experiment freely. 

- Prioritization
    - We had an endless list of bugs and new features we wanted to implement occuring simultaneously. We decided to reprioritize and not include the store model and focus on games and systems. 

- Documenting our technical issues
    - We encountered several technical issues. We began to document our technical issues for future reference and in case one of our teammates encounters it. The following are the technical issues we resolved. 

        - Migration issues 
        - Git conflicts
        - Integrity error on Django
        - Working with databases in SQL

## Next Steps
The following are the next step in improving our application:

- View games based on gaming system
- Incorporate Trivia API for play games section
- Sort trivia questions
